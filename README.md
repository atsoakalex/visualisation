# visualisation

this code is the result of an exercice in witch I created some graphs in javascript base on the informations in the table.
This JavaScript code creates two canvas elements and renders a bar chart and a line chart on them. 
The data for the charts is taken from two HTML tables with ids "table1" and "table2". The code uses the Chart.
js library to create the charts. 
The first chart is a line chart that takes the data from the first table, creates an array of data sets and an array of years, and then initializes the chart with these arrays. 
The second chart is a bar chart that takes the data from the second table, creates an array of data sets and an array of countries, and then initializes the chart with these arrays. 
The options for both charts are set to begin the y-axis at zero.
